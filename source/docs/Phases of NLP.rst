*Phases of NLP*
================
There are the following five phases of NLP:

*1. Lexical Analysis and Morphological*
***************************************
The first phase of NLP is the Lexical Analysis. This phase scans the source code as a stream of characters and converts it into meaningful lexemes. It divides the whole text into paragraphs, sentences, and words.

*2. Syntactic Analysis (Parsing)*
*********************************
Syntactic Analysis is used to check grammar, word arrangements, and shows the relationship among the words.

* **Example:** Agra goes to the Poonam

In the real world, Agra goes to the Poonam, does not make any sense, so this sentence is rejected by the Syntactic analyzer.

*3. Semantic Analysis*
**********************
Semantic analysis is concerned with the meaning representation. It mainly focuses on the literal meaning of words, phrases, and sentences.

*4. Discourse Integration*
**************************

Discourse Integration depends upon the sentences that proceeds it and also invokes the meaning of the sentences that follow it.

*5. Pragmatic Analysis*
************************
Pragmatic is the fifth and last phase of NLP. It helps you to discover the intended effect by applying a set of rules that characterize cooperative dialogues.

* **For Example:** "Open the door" is interpreted as a request instead of an order.
