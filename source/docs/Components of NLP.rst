*Components of NLP*
===================
There are the following two components of NLP -

*1. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)*
*****************************************
Natural Language Understanding (NLU) helps the machine to understand and analyse human language by extracting the metadata from content such as concepts, entities, keywords, emotion, relations, and semantic roles.
NLU mainly used in Business applications to understand the customer's problem in both spoken and written language.
NLU involves the following tasks -
    * It is used to map the given input into useful representation.

    * It is used to analyze different aspects of the language.

*2. Natural Language Generation (NLG)*
**************************************
Natural Language Generation (NLG) acts as a translator that converts the computerized data into natural language representation. It mainly involves Text planning, Sentence planning, and Text Realization.
    
    * **Text planning** − It includes retrieving the relevant content from knowledge base.

    * **Sentence planning** − It includes choosing required words, forming meaningful phrases, setting tone of the sentence. 

    * **Text Realization** − It is mapping sentence plan into sentence structure. 

* **Note:** The NLU is difficult than NLG.
