*Morphological Parsing*
=======================
The term morphological parsing is related to the parsing of morphemes. We can define morphological parsing as the problem of recognizing that a word breaks down into smaller meaningful units called morphemes producing some sort of linguistic structure for it. For example, we can break the word foxes into two, fox and -es. We can see that the word foxes, is made up of two morphemes, one is fox and other is -es.

In other sense, we can say that morphology is the study of −

* The formation of words.

* The origin of the words.

* Grammatical forms of the words.

* Use of prefixes and suffixes in the formation of words.

* How parts-of-speech (PoS) of a language are formed.

*Types of Morphemes*
*********************
Morphemes, the smallest meaning-bearing units, can be divided into two types −

* **Stems**

* **Word Order**

* Stems: It is the core meaningful unit of a word. We can also say that it is the root of the word. For example, in the word foxes, the stem is fox.

* Affixes − As the name suggests, they add some additional meaning and grammatical functions to the words. For example, in the word foxes, the affix is − es.

Further, affixes can also be divided into following four types −

      * **Prefixes** − As the name suggests, prefixes precede the stem. For example, in the word unbuckle, un is the prefix.

      * **Suffixes** − As the name suggests, suffixes follow the stem. For example, in the word cats, -s is the suffix.

      * **Infixes** − As the name suggests, infixes are inserted inside the stem. For example, the word cupful, can be pluralized as cupsful by using -s as the infix.

      * **Circumfixes** − They precede and follow the stem. There are very less examples of circumfixes in English language. A very common example is ‘A-ing’ where we can use -A precede and -ing follows the stem.

*Word Order*
************
The order of the words would be decided by morphological parsing. Let us now see the requirements for building a morphological parser −

*Lexicon*
*********
The very first requirement for building a morphological parser is lexicon, which includes the list of stems and affixes along with the basic information about them. For example, the information like whether the stem is Noun stem or Verb stem, etc.

*Morphotactics*
***************
It is basically the model of morpheme ordering. In other sense, the model explaining which classes of morphemes can follow other classes of morphemes inside a word. For example, the morphotactic fact is that the English plural morpheme always follows the noun rather than preceding it.

*Orthographic rules*
********************
These spelling rules are used to model the changes occurring in a word. For example, the rule of converting y to ie in word like city+s = cities not citys.
